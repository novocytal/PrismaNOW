# prismaNOW â€¢ Listen to your favs from all major music platforms.

prismaNOW is a Discord music and social bot written in [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage") by [Twentysix](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/) (base code) and rewritten and modified by [novocytal](https://github.com/novocytal). It can host a conversation with you, invoke social features for a server, and you can listen to your favorite songs, and help others discover new songs they might like.

### Ideas

As a new Python developer and a server owner, I realize that there are some server owners that want features specific to their server, and want to customize commands for an optimal experience for their members and themselves. That's why I've decided to start to work on a new series of apps -- PRISMA:develop, and PRISMA:engage. 

### PRISMA:develop

Help develop the Prisma platform by collaborating with developers of the Prisma community and contribute your experience, and even get the exposure you need to get big.

### PRISMA:engage

You don't need to speak code to help contribute. Suggest new features, report issues, and as a server owner, you can get commands created that are exclusive to your Discord server.

### Commands & functionality

Video [here](http://about.prismaaux.us.to/ "Prisma platform: 2.0 update").

### Configuration (coming soon)

Pick your version of prismaNOW. Developer release (less stable, but more features), or public release? When PRISMA:engage and PRISMA:develop applications come out, you can choose either one. Simply click the prismaNOW icon on the PRISMA:develop/inspire sidebar, click Install if you haven't, pick your file destination, and you will be guided through setup. For now, the Prisma platform cannot be self-hosted.

### Okay then, how do I add it to my server?
prismaNOW is a social and music bot that ports your song choices over to an inter-server (across many servers) radio bot called prismaAUX. It is recommended to have both bots, as prismaAUX adds a lyrics feature to prismaNOW and prismaNOW adds many social features to prismaAUX. Click [here](http://prismanow.us.to/) to add prismaNOW, but if you want to listen to other people's song choices in the Prisma community, click [here](http://prismaaux.us.to/) for prismaAUX.
